# Introducing RailGrinder
***The ultimate tool for all your Synth Riders score-chasing needs! 
Are you tired of being just another name on the leaderboard? Do you yearn to grind your way to the top with the grace of a gazelle and the precision of a hawk? Look no further!***

It tells you which of your scores have the most potential for improvement. It does this by comparing your score to the average of anyone with a higher score than you. This tool is most effective if your rank is in the top 200.
You can also analyze unplayed songs and estimate where you would rank based on your average accuracy (weighted poor/good/perfect)

Use ```RailGrinder -help``` for information on the commandline mode.

You might need to install the [.net8 runtime](<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.3-windows-x64-installer>)
